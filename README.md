# Does hitting the ball harder make you a more valuable baseball player?

I was watching the New York Mets broadcast when they played a clip from an interview with 2B/OF Jeff McNeil where they discussed his strong start to the 2022 season. (The clip can be found here https://youtu.be/bdelnn9rQT8?t=52) In this interview Jeff credited a change in his approach at the plate to his early success. He states that over the last two seasons he was only trying to hit the ball hard, while this year he is simply "hitting it where they're not". This made me question: Is hitting the ball hard statistcally more valuable? Is there any measureable relationship between hitting the ball hard and total player value?

In this personal project I will look at hitting statistics in MLB to explore a relationship between hard hit balls and player value. The data I will be using will be downloaded in CSV format from baseball-reference at (https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2021-standard-batting.shtml). I will be creating a simple linear regression model for this project to determine if there is any measurable relationship between hard hit rate and Wins Above Replacement(WAR). I will also compare this to the relationship between several "mainstream" baseball statistics and WAR including Batting Average, Runs scored, Runs batted in, and On base plus slugging (OPS).
