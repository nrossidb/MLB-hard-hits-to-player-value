# Does hitting the ball harder make you a more valuable baseball player?

I was watching the New York Mets broadcast when they played a clip from an interview with 2B/OF Jeff McNeil where they discussed his strong start to the 2022 season. (The clip can be found here https://youtu.be/bdelnn9rQT8?t=52) In this interview Jeff credited a change in his approach at the plate to his early success. He states that over the last two seasons he was only trying to hit the ball hard, while this year he is simply "hitting it where they're not". This made me question: Is hitting the ball hard statistcally more valuable? Is there any correlation between hitting the ball hard and total player value?

In this personal project I will look at hitting statistics in MLB to explore a relationship between hard hit balls and player value. The data I will be using will be downloaded in CSV format from baseball-reference at (https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2021-standard-batting.shtml). I will be creating models for this project using different types of regression and comparing the results.
