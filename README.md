# Hard_hit_ds_project

Does hitting the ball harder make you a more valuable baseball player?

In this personal project I will look at hitting statistics in MLB to explore a relationship between hard hit balls and player value. The data I will be using will be downloaded in CSV format from baseball-reference at (https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2021-standard-batting.shtml). I will be creating models for this project using different types of regression and comparing the results.
